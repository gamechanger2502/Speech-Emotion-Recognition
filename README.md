# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition System developed using Deep Learning (LSTM) model

<h2> What's in it </h2>
So we have used DL model to predict the emotion of user. 
Since the model is DL, it takes some time to run in Jupyter Notebook and would
recommend to use Kaggle's GPU for running the code.
